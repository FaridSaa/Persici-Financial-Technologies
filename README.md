*Project Report*

Architecture:
I utilized the Onion (Layered) Architecture with a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach in mind , enhancing the maintainability, scalability, and testability of the application.

Functionality:
The system's functionality has been redesigned from the ground up to work seamlessly across any city, any year and any set of rules, providing a highly flexible and adaptable solution.

Data Accessibility:
I implemented Entity Framework Core (EF Core) as the ORM to ensure flexibility and performance. This choice allows the system to work with any SQL-based relational database supported by the ORM and can be adapted to work with files or any other data source with minimal modifications.

Testability:
Testing is handled using the xUnit testing framework, applying the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern to ensure clear, maintainable, and reliable test cases.
